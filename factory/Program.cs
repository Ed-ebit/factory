// In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that
// uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify
// the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling
// a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes,
// or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather
// than by calling a constructor.
